## Who is the author?

I go by the name mdcu.firebase. Obiviously, this is an alias name. I'm a fulltime physician, a hobbyist web-developer, statistician wanna-be, and part-time data scientist. I'm introvert and self-centric. My skill deck comprises of javascript, CSS, R, spreadsheet, google action script, and basic Python. I love open source and worship Google. I detaste Apple devices and operation system and will never create anything Apple-first. Being a doctor and programmer, I think the worst readable script on Earth is laws.

## what is onka.js

onka.js refers to a personal web-development package to work with HTML5, JS-ES6, CSS3. While the name ends with .js, the package actually contains multiple .js and .css files that work together.

## Principle

onka.js is standalone self-competent package meaning that it requires no dependency outside of the package. Some functions may resemble the popular framework like $ form JQuery but are acutally different which may cause confusion due to differ behaviours. But I will not change anything because I intend to build them according to my personal favour.

## Focus

### .js objectives

- personal preference DOM access and manipualtion style
- working with <input> and relatives
- database work in frontend

### .css objectives

- minimalist design which try to make desktop and mobile appearance similar (not responsive, I just not agree with the universe)
- special preference on monochrome and pastel palette
